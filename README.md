This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: using the `ubuntu:latest` image. This can lead to inconsistent builds as the base image changes over time.  The solution shows how to use a specific Ubuntu version for reproducible builds.  This is crucial for reliable CI/CD pipelines and consistent deployments.
